As Bitcoin approaches its second decade of existence, opinions about the cryptocurrency continue to vary widely, ranging from "Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme" to "Bitcoin is the only thing we need." As someone who has been involved in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general since 2015-16, I have formed my own opinions on the subject by seeking out diverse perspectives from various sources such as the internet, books, and interviews.

Overall, my view is that Bitcoin is attempting to solve one of the most difficult problems ever faced: trustless transactions. However, achieving this goal is not without risks. In this post, I will explain both my belief in and my skepticism about Bitcoin.

One key aspect of owning assets is the control that the owner has over them. The more control, the lower the risk for the owner. To my knowledge, there is no asset that provides full control while also maintaining its value. Real estate, for example, requires the payment of property taxes that are controlled by the government and can be seized for various reasons. Gold offers more control, but as a physical asset, it is more prone to being noticed and can require physical trade to transact. Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides its owner complete control, particularly with tools like Brainwallet, which allows users to store their bitcoins in their brain simply by memorizing a phrase.

One of the major issues that humanity has sought to address in the creation of a monetary system is the need for trust in other people. Unfortunately, all previous solutions have required some level of trust in other humans, who are often greedy, biased, and emotional. In the past, gold coins were used as money, but they could be easily debased by mixing them with other metals without anyone's knowledge. Validating the purity of gold is not feasible during every transaction and is also incredibly slow. Trademarked gold coins, which are certified by an entity to be pure, do exist, but these entities are operated by humans who are also subject to corruption, especially during difficult times.

Currently, we use fiat money, which is certified by governments to have "some" value. However, fiat money also suffers from debasement, as governments may choose to print more money (through quantitative easing) instead of making difficult decisions such as increasing taxes or correcting resource allocations during tough times. We saw this happen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is supported by a network that is highly decentralized and therefore immutable. No other cryptocurrency has the same level of hash rate as Bitcoin, which refers to the computing power backing the network and contributing to its decentralization. The Bitcoin network is also validated in real-time by its nodes, making it nearly impossible to debase a Bitcoin. While Bitcoin transactions may take longer to be validated and are not suitable for instant transactions, these are higher-order problems that can be addressed by implementing another layer for faster transactions, such as the Lightning Network.

Despite its potential, Bitcoin also has its drawbacks. One of the main risks is the possibility of a 51% attack, in which a group of miners or nodes controlling more than half of the network's hash rate could potentially rewrite transaction history or prevent new transactions from being added. While this risk is low due to the high level of decentralization of the network, it is not impossible.

Another risk is the lack of regulation, which can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to know how to properly handle Bitcoin. This lack of clarity can lead to misunderstandings and legal issues.

In conclusion, while I believe in the potential of Bitcoin to solve the problem of trustless transactions, it is not without its risks. The decentralization and immutability of the network make it a valuable asset,
