Today, everyone consumes information through several channels such as social media, news media, friends, professionals etc. Social Media in particular plays a big role in information sharing as it has completely democratized the content creator space. Although, the original goal of connected world appeared to be really helpful in the beginning, today however, it is hurting the world IMO. After a decade, as we know, it is not uncommon for someone to gain millions of followers, and hence, fanout factor for sharing information is huge. Back in 90s this wasn't the case. First, there were only small number of famous people. Second, it wasn't always so quick for them to share information with their audience. Today, someone with a millions of followers can spread information to all their audience in a matter of seconds!

If we see below, as of 2020, YouTube has more than 22k channels that have more than 1M+ subscribes. Now in 2022, this count seems to be around 30k. Similar trends are even more widespread in Instagram, Twitter and TikTok.

But people gaining followers is not the main problem. Problem is monetization of the audience they have. When we allow creators to monetize their content on social media, it brings out the worst of the people. More often than not, due to the lucrative nature and hyper growth environment of social media, everyone wants to make more and more money. This causes a vicious cycle among creators, which revolves around, "how can I get more people's eyes on my content?".

These impressions are important for creators because their compensation is directly correlated with it i.e. the more eyes they get on their content, the more they are paid. Also, there are sponsorships that also hire creators to promote their products based on similar metrics such as subscriber counts, views, etc. Hence, creators soon start a never ending journey of gaining more and more audience to earn more money.

To gain more audience, creators publish clickbait headlines, video thumbnails, pictures etc. But soon that also doesn't work due to fierce competition in social media. Then, some of them start being disingenuous, and publish all kinds of content without even thinking the impact on the society. Once that also wears out, these creators eat on each other with "reaction" videos, or simply hate videos. It is very common to react to or hate big creators, because those contents have bigger chances to go viral and hence larger followers gain. All this can get someone to a decent place where they can make content creation their primary job. But unfortunately, the journey doesn't stop there.

Things become a lot more convoluted when someone has larger follower counts. For example, they get bombarded by sponsorships, where they are literally paid to say nice things about sponsor's products despite the quality of the product. This is where many creators become completely dishonest to their audience and start promoting products as if it was their own opinion. These things simply challenge the ethics of creators, and test their limits to be bought by sponsors. In the financial world, these creators promote financial securities like stocks and cryptocurrencies but rarely disclose if they are paid to do so. A few days ago, Kim Kardashian was fined `$1.3M` from SEC to promote a scam cryptocurrency which made people lose a lot of money. Now, you see if a billionaire like Kim can do it for only `$250k`, how many others who actually need money will be willing to do similar things? and they do.

There are many such examples in social media today. Basically, it has become a place where none of the information can be trusted because everyone is paid for. It is like old-school media that we knew was paid for, but only on steroids.

# What can we do?

Because I know these things are not in my control, I personally try to implement some principles in my life. Though, I know this is not really a scalable solution to solve this problem, I still do want to mention it nevertheless.

As creators, think long term. Yes, in the short term we can gain more attention using shortcuts like clickbaits. But, if we want a long term following and income, shortcuts won't be sustainable. Users will eventually discover these tactics and that's when stagnation or even downturn starts.

As consumers, always seek to disprove your learned beliefs. We need to always take anything on social media as a grain of salt. Simply assume that the information we're watching is most likely paid for and hence may be biased. Hence, we must go out there to disprove those beliefs through multiple other channels, people or through our own experiences. Additionally, we must try to understand the motives behind someone posting something on Social Media, and understand that nothing comes for free. If someone is spending time to create content, they may have monetary motives (directly or indirectly) and hence may be biased.

# What other options we might have?

## Ban content monetization

Banning content monetization would make people not chase money and hence not post clickbait or disingenuous content. But is it really practical? I don't think so.

## Legally enforce full disclosure

I think, one way would be to enforce the law to make sure creators disclose every reason behind their content if they expect a monetary gain, directly or indirectly. However, clearly, doing so at the internet scale is hard. And even harder and slower for government to implement. It is also hard because sometimes it is just impossible to know someone's motives.

## Make creator's financial accounts public

One other thing we can do is to make creator's business bank account public, legally (similar to 13F SEC filings). It is much easier to govern that account is public than to check every content if creators have disclosed all motives. And then build technical solutions on top to correlate whether someone was paid or not to publish their content. This would require understanding the content as well as classifying the transactions most likely using a machine learning model and then correlating and annotating them on the platform. Though, two major issues with this approach are, 1) making a bank account public would put someone at risk, 2) people are probably going to get paid few days after they publish the content, hence risk of non-disclosure until then.

## Blockchain - integrate money and content together

Perhaps another solution would be to somehow bring the money and content together in an enforced manner using a blockchain, such that we can make the internet transparent by showing how certain content makes money. I don't know how to implement something like that, but I will keep thinking about it. Feel free to leave your comments or thoughts below. Sometimes, gains may not be for money, rather other materialistic things. Digitize them all through a blockchain? What if gains are not really materialistic? For example - someone posting a reaction content on a celebrity to gain followers.

Regardless, I am not an expert. Just someone who think about these things often. Purpose of this post is to increase awareness so more of us think about these difficult problems together because they impact us all and more importantly our upcoming generations. And perhaps one day we will have a perfect solution to this problem! Feel free to leave your thoughts below. Thank you for reading.
