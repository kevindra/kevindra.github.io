This is a follow up of my previous blog post - Is Content Monetization Damaging the World, if you haven't read it, I suggest that you do. I spent 11 years of my life at Amazon and I am a big fan of Amazon's leadership principles. Are Right, A Lot is one of the 16 leadership principles, which I didn't embrace in my early years as much as I embraced others. It states as follows:

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

As I grew over time as a leader, I started embracing Are Right, A Lot a lot more than the other leadership principles, simply because I felt a deep sense of accountability towards the decisions I make. I learned, as a leader, when you are wrong about your decisions, it impacts the people you lead and millions of users that are using your products, sometimes in a bad way. Hence, as a leader, it is important that before you make a decision, you be thorough, objective and take many perspectives into account (especially the ones that are opposite of yours).

As you may think, due to the due diligence involved in such a process, making right decisions can be slow. And that's where we have to balance the speed of decision making with risk of the decision itself. Which comes with experience and I am learning to be efficient in this area.

In social media today, people with high influence (100k+ followers) can be easily considered leaders. Their decisions and content impact many lives. However, a common practice among these people is that if they are wrong about something, they take down that content from past. They also proactively silence free speech by deleting comments on their content that may damage their image. They are competing to gain more following, and it is hard to do that if they were seemingly wrong many times. See an example from Sam Bankman Fried, who assured that FTX, one of the biggest Crypto exchanges, is fine, just HOURS before it went bust. And later on, he deleted this tweet to somewhat improve his image. Completely, unethical and disrespectful to people who made him a Billionaire.

Most social media influencers simply get away with spreading lies like this and not be held accountable. With so much information out there, it is hard for people to track when these people were wrong in the past, especially because they delete the content. And there is always recency bias in play, that contribute to their majority of their image. In my opinion, we must accept that we can be wrong with our words and own the consequences of our words, even if it destroys our image. Can we do something about this?

In the last few weeks, I have been thinking about a way to enforce that people do accept the impact of their words. One way is that we make deleted content visible on the internet, so people can make an informed decision about someone's behavior by learning their history of wrong or misled decisions. I think, it would be great if there was a simple archive of some sort that collates all the content (especially the deleted one) from all the social media. And later, build an analysis of someone such as how many times have they been right or wrong in the past objectively? I think, we need a platform like this to keep every public figure accountable and I'm going to spend my free time building this tool in the next few coming weeks. If you are a software engineer or just passionate about these things and like to team up, do reach out to me. Let's make this world a better place, together!
