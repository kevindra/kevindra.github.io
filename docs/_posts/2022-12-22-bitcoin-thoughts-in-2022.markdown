[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) has now existed for over a decade. As it gained momentum in the world, it also developed many opinions with extremes from "Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme" all the way to "Bitcoin is the only thing we need". I have been involved in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general since 2015-16, and have followed the journey somewhat closely. Overtime I also developed my own opinions and I did so by seeking diverse perspectives from all around the internet, books, interviews etc. Overall my high level opinion is that Bitcoin is solving one of the most difficult problems that hasn't never been solved before i.e. trustless transactions (yes I meant Bitcoin, not just Blockchain, more on this later). Having said that, the path to reaching its goal does not come risk free. In this post, I would like to share why I believe in Bitcoin and why I don't.

## Control

When owning assets, one of the most important aspects is how much control the owner has over it. The less the control, the more the risk for the owner. To my knowledge, there is no asset out there that provides its owner full control, while still maintaining the value. For instance, real estate - even if you own a piece of land you still have to pay property taxes, which is in control of the government. It can also be forfeited to government for many reasons. Gold provides more control, however, it being physical has higher chances of getting someone's attention, especially when to transact you have to physically trade it.
Bitcoin provides its owner complete control, especially with tools like [Brainwallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet), we can store the bitcoins in our brain just by memorizing a phrase. Now, unless someone has a way to read mind thoughts, it's really impossible to know if someone has millions of dollars in a Bitcoin wallet, right?

## Trustless

Human race has tried to come up with better and better money system for the society. Unfortunately, all the solutions before Bitcoin required some form of trust on another human being. Most human beings are greedy, biased and emotional. In the past, people used gold coins as money, however, these coins can be easily debased by mixing with copper (or some other metal) without anyone's knowledge. Gold validation isn't available at everyone's disposal during the transaction and is rather immensely slow. There are mechanisms such as trademarked Gold coins, which basically mean that coin is certified by an entity to be pure. However, these entities are operated by other human beings and hence, susceptible to the same corruption especially during hard times.

Now-a-days we use [FIAT money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) to transact value. These are basically certified by the government to promise that they hold "some" value. But they also suffer with the same debasing problem. In tough times, government conveniently chooses a path of least resistance i.e. to debase the money by printing more (Quantitative Easing/QE) as opposed to making hard decisions such as increasing taxes or correcting the resources allocations. We have all seen what happened during the COVID time.

Bitcoin is backed by a network that is the **most decentralized**, and hence **immutable**. There is no other crypto currency out there that has the same hash rate as Bitcoin. Hash rate means how much computing power is backing the network, hence, helping the network get decentralized. Below, we see how Bitcoin's hash rate has grown over time.

In addition, Bitcoin is validated in real-time by these nodes in the network, hence, quite impossible to debase a Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin can take more time to be validated and is not helpful for instant transactions. To me, these are higher order problems and can be solved by implementing another layer for faster transactions. Banks do this all the time by settling transactions slowly and stock market has market makers as liquidity providers for the same reason too. One thing that community often misses is that with high degree of decentralization comes with slow transaction speed. In physical world, same is true with Gold, in order to validate that gold is pure, you will have to spend time. Same is true with Bitcoin, except the trustless factor is much higher than Gold validators. Over the last few years, people have built many crypto currencies that promise speed (such as Bitcoin Cash), to me they reek of human greed, pump and dump kind of schemes. They lack the decentralization, hence, not really solving the original problem of trustless transactions.

## Value

A **trustless** asset that provides a complete owner control is still nothing if it doesn't have a value. Imagine owning a Ferrari on the Moon! So, does Bitcoin has value? That is a great question, but before I answer that, I will explain what I learned about concept of value. In my opinion, a value is just someone's perceived desire to own things that exist in the world. For example - a piece of wood may not be very valuable to me but is very valuable to someone who doesn't have access to any heat source. Value is usually a result of human emotions and needs.
In the example above, if I were to transact with the wood I have, I must find people who may need wood. Hence, for something to be globally valuable, it must also have humans desiring it globally. It is even more important for money, because money is used to transact all around the world. On the other hand, collectibles such as artwork, watches do not require wide spread adoption, as they are rare with small communities of people who desire them. Hence, in order to increase global value of something, it must also trigger global adoption.
Bitcoin's value is also defined by how much it is desired by the world. If entire world believes that they can trade an XBox using 1 Bitcoin, its average value per coin will be considered to be the $ price of XBox. So, as long as all of us believe that it can buy us something, it will continue to be valuable. Yes, this value discovery process can be volatile for a quite long time.

## Potential Risks

### 1. Adoption

Since Bitcoin's value directly correlates with its adoption worldwide, it is one of the biggest risks. So far, adoption trend has been positive, however, if that falls drastically, that can add more risk to the Bitcoin concept.

### 2. Volatility

The more people trade Bitcoin with other crypto and FIAT currencies, the more it can prove to be volatile. Which means that someone can lose their purchasing power quickly. Though, it is a sign of lack of use for real transactions, once we gain more momentum, I think, the volatility should stabilize. However, this may take years or decades.

### 3. Government Ban

Even though there is no single entity that owns the Bitcoin network, governments can still indirectly ban it by banning Mining or just by declaring that owning Bitcoin is illegal. Though, it will not kill the network or its use as it is global.

## Potential Catalysts

### 1. Strong U.S. Dollar

As we know that other U.S. Dollar is the [world's dominant reserve currency](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11707). A reserve currency is a currency held by central banks in significant quantities, used to conduct international trade and financial transactions, eliminating the costs of settling transactions involving different currencies. This is what gives U.S. dollar and U.S. power, because they can print more money and spend due to high dollar international demand. More recently (2022), Federal Reserve has been tightening the money supply to overcome inflation. Which directly explodes the cost of international trades for non U.S. countries, as well as the dollar denominated debt they have. Because of this, [many countries have now started to face tough times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/business/economy/us-dollar-global-impact.html).‌‌

![Weakening Currencies](../assets/images/weakening-currencies.png)

Hence, I believe the more world sees U.S. Dollar as risk, the more they would want to decouple from it. However, they will still incur the high settlement fees during trades. I believe, this may trigger de-globalization in the short term, until countries realize that we still need a reserve currency, and since they don't trust other countries' currencies, Bitcoin will stand as the only shiny option. Well, gold may be the other one, except, the velocity will suffer.

### 2. FIAT currency failures

With such low currency values, I believe, governments will have no option but to ease the Quantitative tightening protocols. And if Fed doesn't pivot, they may have to print to overcome the strength of the U.S. Dollar. For instance - [British market showed some cracks recently, followed by a reversal by the Bank of England](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/bank-of-england-delays-bond-sales-launches-temporary-purchase-program.html).

## Other Questions that popped in mind from time to time

### Bitcoin is deflationary?

Deflationary currency would mean that with time, prices of things come down slowly (hence opposite of inflation). This can cause people to delay spending and maximizing savings. That is the reason why people are hoarding Bitcoin as they believe its value is going up. However, as adoption increases, Bitcoin's price wouldn't be as volatile. Additionally, Bitcoin's supply is inflationary because every 10 minutes certain number of Bitcoins are transferred to miners. Which comes out to be about 1-2% of total bitcoin supply. Hence, making Bitcoin as inflationary as the desired inflation rate by the Federal Reserve.

### Energy Consumption?

I believe, building a trustless network has a cost attached to it, which is computing. Total global estimated electricity usage for blockchains that support crypto-assets in 2022 falls into a range of 120 to 240 billion kWh per year.56 This is equivalent to 0.4% to 0.9% of annual global electricity usage. Ref - White House Crypto Asset Climate report 2022. Out of which, bitcoin would be 0.2% to 0.5%, per its market domination. Is that too high a cost for running a trustless network? I'm not sure. But eventually, I think, we will find efficient solutions.

### Proof of Stake?

Although, proof of stake networks are 99%+ more energy efficient than proof of work networks (bitcoin is one), in my opinion, proof of stake networks pose a big risk to decentralization and hence trustless-ness of a network. In the beginning, it may appear that stakes are widely decentralized. However, these assets can be manipulated heavily by big funds over time and with enough fear-mongering and other similar tactics, entities can accumulate enough stake to be 50%+, hence, risking the network's viability.

As data firm Messari has pointed out, Lido Finance controls a whopping 31.2% of all staked Ether on the Beacon Chain, while Coinbase controls 14.7% and Kraken 8.5%. Ref - Why is the merge controversial?

### Mining concentration?

It is a great concern as minor concentration is real. It appears that single digit % miners control the 90% plus bitcoin mining capacity, which can make bitcoin network susceptible to 51% attack. In my mind, this is also a risk which should subside as the adoption increase. Though I'm not fully sure yet.

### Deploying other Crypto on BTC network?

What if there was a way to deploy a new crypto currency on bitcoin network nodes? Wouldn't that be an instant replica of bitcoin network? Yes, it would be. However, this is not possible and will require manual human effort to install either a daemon or some process that will run in parallel to Bitcoin's daemon. If it took Bitcoin miners 10+ years to setup the current compute, it would probably take high single digit years to setup another. But then miners may ask why not just use Bitcoin?

### Other Crypto Currencies?

Yes, there are other crypto currencies out there (thousands). But none have as much hash power as Bitcoin, hence they are not decentralized.

There were many other topics that I thought about in past few years, but these are the main ones. This post is a reason why I believe in Bitcoin, however, as you may now tell, I'm also not 100% convinced due to the risks.

Regardless, I firmly believe in a future where decisions are not taken by humans who can be persuaded by many different aspects, rather decisions are taken by machines. Whether it's Bitcoin or something else, hopefully, we will know within our lifetimes.
